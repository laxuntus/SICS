This repository hold the R-code related to _Sparse invariant coordinate selection (SICS)_ proposed in _A method for sparse and robust independent component analysis_ by Heinonen and Virta (2025)

Sparse invariant coordinate selection is a new method for sparse and robust independent component analysis. SICS is based on classical invariant coordinate selection, which is presented in such a form that a LASSO-type penalty can be applied to promote sparsity. Robustness can be achieved by using robust scatter matrices.
